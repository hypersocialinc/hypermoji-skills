# Hypermoji

Use this skill when the user wants to create mascots, generate emote sets, import a character, inspect jobs, or download assets through the Hypermoji CLI.

## Prerequisites

- `hypermoji` must be installed and available on `PATH`
- the user must already be authenticated with `hypermoji login`

Check auth first:

```bash
hypermoji --json whoami
```

If that fails, stop and tell the user to run:

```bash
hypermoji login
```

## Core Rules

- Prefer `--json` for commands when you need structured output
- For long-running operations, create the job, then wait for it
- Use batch emote generation instead of multiple single emote commands
- Do not try to automate the browser login flow from this skill

## Mascot Creation Workflow

1. Check auth
2. Optionally inspect styles:

```bash
hypermoji --json styles list
```

3. Create the mascot:

```bash
hypermoji --json mascots create "<prompt>"
```

4. Wait for the job:

```bash
hypermoji --json jobs wait <job-id>
```

5. Review the returned variations and pick the best one
6. Select the chosen mascot:

```bash
hypermoji --json mascots select <mascot-id>
```

7. Fetch the final mascot details:

```bash
hypermoji --json mascots get <mascot-id>
```

## Emote Generation Workflow

Use this when the user wants an emote pack or emote set.

Suggested default set:

- waving hello
- thinking
- celebrating
- typing
- surprised
- sad

Generate in parallel:

```bash
hypermoji --json emotes batch <mascot-id> "waving hello" "thinking" "celebrating" "typing" "surprised" "sad"
```

Then inspect or wait on the returned jobs:

```bash
hypermoji --json jobs list
hypermoji --json jobs wait <job-id>
```

List emotes for the mascot:

```bash
hypermoji --json emotes list <mascot-id>
```

## Import Workflow

Import a mascot from a public image URL:

```bash
hypermoji --json mascots import <image-url>
```

Then wait for the job and inspect the resulting mascot.

If the installed CLI does not support `mascots import`, tell the user their CLI is older than the skill expects and ask them to upgrade.

## Downloads

Fetch details first, then download what the user needs:

```bash
hypermoji --json mascots get <mascot-id>
hypermoji --json emotes get <emote-id>
hypermoji emotes download <emote-id> --format all
```

## Prompt Guidance

Use prompts that describe the result directly:

- character identity
- expression or action
- color palette
- outfit or props
- animation or framing intent

Prefer “inspired by” wording over exact copyrighted character names or exact studio mimicry. Safer examples:

- “a manic green-faced trickster inspired by 90s slapstick comedy”
- “classic family-friendly feature animation look”

Avoid asking for an exact living artist’s style or an exact copyrighted character recreation when a looser prompt will achieve the same goal.

## Output Handling

When using `--json`, parse these common response fields:

- mascot creation: `jobId`, `mascotIds`
- emote creation: `jobId`, `emoteId`
- batch emotes: `emotes[]`
- jobs wait/status: `status`, `variations`, `emoteId`

For user-facing responses:

- summarize what was created
- include the selected mascot ID or emote IDs
- note any remaining manual step only if one actually remains
